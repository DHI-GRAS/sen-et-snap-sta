## Sen-Et SNAP standalone tool adapter

This repository contains the implementation of the Sen-ET SNAP standalone tool adapter

## Sen-Et plugin

The Sen-Et plugin can be downloaded from the Sen-ET website (http://esa-sen4et.org/outputs/software).

## Description

The purpose of the Sen-ET SNAP plugin is to enable estimation of actual evapotran-spiration (and other land-surface energy fluxes) at field scale using Sentinel-2 (S2) andSentinel-3 (S3) satellite observations as well as meteorological data available from Coper-nicus Climate Data Store. It was developed as part of the Sen-ET project (http://esa-sen4et.org/) and consists of open-source Python libraries and thin wrapper enabling exe-cution from within SNAP graphical user interface (GUI).
